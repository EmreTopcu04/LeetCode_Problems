## Relatively Easy Question

We are setting the smallest number into the first element of the array since it will always exist.

After that, we need to check whether there are any closest numbers other than the first element in the list and do so until we reach the list's length.

After that, we need to check whether the closest value is smaller than 0 and the absolute value of it is in nums since if both of them exist, we need to use the positive; if not, we need to use the existing.
