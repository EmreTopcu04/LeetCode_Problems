## Relatively Easy Question

We are starting by adding each roman number into a map so that we can access them later on, after that, we are starting to iterate through the string to find the characters, after that when we reach the character we are checking whether the character we are looking is smaller than the one on it's right or not. If it is, we are substracting them from each other and increment i by two. If not, we are simply adding our value to the sum and increment i by one. After finishing this. We return the sum.
